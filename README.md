# Image-Classification
This repository includes training a baseline AlexNet model and fine-tuning a pretrained InceptionV3 model on a dataset of 25k 150x150 images from 6 categories: buildings, forest, glacier, mountain, sea, and street. Additionally, a simple deployment using Streamlit is provided for model inference.
